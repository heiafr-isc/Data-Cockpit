## Introduction

Data-Cockpit is a suite of integrated software tools designed for configuring, executing, and visualizing digital experiments. A digital experiment involves running a software application based on predefined hypotheses and parameters to perform calculations and generate results. Experiment plans involve multiple runs of the software with varying configurations, enabling users to compare the impact of different parameters, hypotheses, or strategies on the outcomes.

Data-Cockpit facilitates the entire process, from the setup and execution of experiments to the analysis of data generated by Java programs.

## Installation

In order to use this program for development purpose, anyone can freely fork this project. The code-base comes with all the different Data-Cockpit components ready to use in their latest version. 
As the Data-Cockpit is still under development, it currently still relies on the availability of the `/div` folder located at the root of the project. This folder contains various mandatory configurations used to set the project and to enable the logging feature. 
Even if the project is ready to be used without further configuration, the removal of these configurations are planned for future releases. 

To find more information about concrete use of the program, check the [Usage](#usage) entry below. 

## Usage

The Data-Cockpit can be used to configure, run and visualize various execution plans. This can be achieved by creating its own implementations of the Experiment interface. 

Then, the Tree component is responsible for the enumeration of all the available Experiment configuration within the program and will display them by using its own GUI. 
The Database component registers all the `Datapoint` object created by the Tree and will manage them in order to redistribute them to the visualizer component or any other visualizer tools a user may have produced. 
The Visualizer component is responsible for Data rendering by using various available graphs. It fetches the content of the Database component and compute the received information.
