# Reporting Security Issues

The Data-Cockpit team takes security bugs in its project seriously. We appreciate your 
efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge
your contributions.

To report a security issue, please contact one of the Maintainers or Admin on [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/GYHqyQYg7V) directly. Avoid public discussion of security issues until they are resolved.

The Data-Cockpit team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your 
report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed 
of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional 
information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. 
Use the corresponding issue tracker for the module to report the issue.
